# 1.0.0-TB2.beta4: Change Log
Date: November 5th, 2021

## Objects
- fluid.waveform~ is a new JSUI abstraction that allows you to draw and overlay the contents of audio, feature curves and segmentation from buffers in a visual display.
- FluidWaveform is the SuperCollider class that mirrors the Max JSUI abstraction.
- SuperCollider has a a new class, FluidPlotter, that allows you to plot points in a two-dimensional canvas.
- Pure Data now has an abstraction that mirrors the functionality `fluid.plotter`.

## Interfaces and Behaviours
- `fluid.plotter` has a modified interface compared to its original release in beta3. It is worth checking the help file for these changes if you use the object as they are subtle but breaking. Namely, there are new ways for managing the properties of individual points such as their colour and size. (https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-max/pull/69)
- `fluid.plotter` will deterministically colour points when the number of clusters exceeds the number of possible colours in a palette. (https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-max/pull/72)

## Fixes
- Calling `load` on a dataset with no arguments no longer crashes Max. (https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-max/pull/61)
- Unnamed objects that rely on `libmanipulation` will now generate unique names so that all unnamed objects no longer talk to each other across a patch. This means that unnamed objects will behave the same as they did prior to the addition of named objects. (https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-max/pull/57)
- Stricter ordering for access to `mDone` in the NRT Wrapper. https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-sc/pull/30

## Tooling
- Copy the `jsui` and `js` folder when building the Max package.

---

# 1.0.0-TB2.beta3:
Date: Oct 25th, 2021

## CCE
- PureData has parity with other CCE's except for:
	- `load` and `dump` methods for DataSet and LabelSet (workaround in place)
	- Limited help-files. These will be updated A.S.A.P and posted as they are updated.
	- Limited testing of the new objects, accordingly.

## Objects
- New Objects
	- FluidGrid: coerce data in a FluidDataSet into a two-dimensional grid
	- FluidStats: compute real-time statistics (mean and stddev) on data streams		
	- MAX: FluidPlotter: Rapidly plot two-dimensional datasets
	- MAX+PD `fluid.buf2list` and `fluid.list2buf` are now compiled objects. Be aware of their new attributes in Max
	- SC: FluidBufToKr and FluidKrToBuf pseudo-Ugens help with the dataset to descriptor to dataset workflow
- New Sounds
	- trombone long tones, and oboe multiphonics, now included.

## Interfaces and Behaviours
- FluidMFCC has a new attribute: "startCoef" which modifies which coefficients are returned by the algorithm. A common use case is to discard the first coefficient.
- MAX+PD: All data objects can be named to share persistent state. For example, `fluid.kdtree~ my-tree` in Max can be used everywhere throughout a patch to reference the same k-d tree named `my-tree`.

## Fixes
- Improved performance with FluidAmpGate
- Crashes caused by (tapin - tapout == 0) on FluidMLP
- Crashes caused by when loading MLP models from JSON
- FluidLoudness no longer spikes to the maximum on digital silence
- Many other fixes, see the `git` log for details.
- BREAKING: BufSelectEvery's method `channelhop`is now `chanhop`to be consistent

## Tooling
- Compilation on Arch Linux is now made possible again by fixing linking against the cutting edge of Boost.
- Building no longer uses AVX instructions by default to allow for an easier experience compiling for M1 Mac and ARM processors.
- Max compilation can now also uses the 8.2 SDK

===
# Beta-02:
date: June 2nd, 2021

- New object: (buf)chroma for pitch class histograms
- New overview of all objects
- Log frequency and power magnitude options in SpectralShape

- Log output option to melbands
- Change of MFCC outs
- change of unit of rolloff and new parameter to set the value (instead of fixed to 95%)

- Some protection against thread conflicts in the dataset objects
- Pitch new default when no pitch detected (0 Hz or -999midi)
- Fixed Cosine distances in Onset and MDS
- Fix in PCA for size=dimcount
- Max: basic hints for inlets and outlets

#### Known bugs:
Windows (Max + SC): Pitch's Yin algo yields a few error frames at its start, but not every time. This also affects Novelty by Pitch. We're chasing.

Linux (SC): SpectralShape has infrequent random outputs. We're chasing that one too.

Windows (Max): bufthreaddemo is not working well. The real threading is working but the explanation object is not.

Linux (SC): example 13 (massive parallelisation) is not working.

* Max: tutorial on simple regression feature comparison
* SC: working autoencoder as dataredux (the other part will come soon here)

## Breaking changes:

### MLPregressor

* outputLayer is now tapOut. Its numbering is now different: 0 counting from the input layer, so 1 is the first hidden layer and -1 is the default (the last, like all our interface).
* it has a new friend, tapIn, which allows you to feed the data for predict and predictpoint in the middle somewhere. 0 is the input, and 1 is the first hidden layer

### Normalize and Standardize

* now have an ‘inverse’ parameters for transform and transformPoint to allow query from the transformed space to the original.

### PCA

Now returns/passes the variance, aka the fidelity of the new representation for a given number of dimensions.

### SC-kr

Most TB1 objects have a blocking mode in KR which allow to keep them on the main buffer thread of the server (faster for small jobs avoiding large memory copying)

## Bugfixes:

* all json load/save/states bugs/oddities reported
* Max: cluttering when buffer resizing
* bufnmf parameter check order
* general buf resize sanity check
* Max: buf resize of dataset is done just in low priority thread (faking mode 2 otherwise)

# TB2 Alpha 04
July 17 2020

===
# TB2 Alpha 03
June 20 2020

## Major changes in the SC interface.
 Most of your code will break but this is for the best. To make it short, read the help files and example code. They rock.

* we can now populate dataset 3 ways:  via Dictionaries, via single buffer triggered from language (Routine, the old way, but faster) and all on the server-side (via Done.kr and triggers). And it is mixed and matched too!
* added utilities to build corpus change their format
* all help files have examples
* the learning examples are updated too

## Max
* unified dataset builder helpers format
* helpfiles have had a lot of typos/loading issues now sorted
* super mega bug in TB1 that nobody found before because it was so edge-case… now sorted :wink:

## All
* 3 new sounds as an example (feel free to let us know what is missing, and who knows, you might even want to contribute)
* [breaking change] human-readable JSON

# TB2 Alpha02
May 21 2020

## A few notes:

    Keep your version of TB1 RC1. The TB2 download has everything, but is from another (much more daring) branch of development. We should have fixed all the bugs but we are not certain it is gig ready!

    The many, many interface break should moan in your CCE window. The most important one is that datasets do not need a fixed size as argument, so most arguments have disappeared from objects. This is a lot more flexible as you will discover.

## New stuff:

    As requested, we have commented the tutorials in Max - the SC people should read them too (they will be translated soon) as it is simple Max yet introduce interesting database concepts with links to scikitlearn documentation.

## Quite Improved:

    Helpfiles - most of them are great, some ok, a few stubs but in those cases the learning examples are there to help
    so many bugs fixed! Gazillions!

## New possibilities:

    dimensionality reduction algorithms (PCA and MDS (with 7 metrics)
    making subsets of dataset via datasetquery
    new buffer manipulation utilities in Max
    weighted KNN classification / regression
    dumping datasets (dump is all as json, print is a useful sample as string)

## New behaviours:

    the said weighted KNN classification / regression is now default
    major interface unification inspired by scikit learn’s syntax to help tap into their learning resources

## SC specific:

    Redesign of language classes and server plugin so that Dataset, Labelset and the various models (KDTree etc) persist for the whole server lifetime, and don’t vanish on cmd+.
    Dataset and Labelset will now throw an exception if you try and create two instances with the same name. However, all instances are cached, similar to Buffer, and there are now class level ‘at’ functions so you can retrieve an extant instance using its name.
    Work on a much streamlined approach for populating and querying without so much back and forth between language and server is ongoing, and will be our main focus in the next alpha. Experimental approaches are currently at the promising-but-dangerous stage.

## Known Issues:

    Max: we have not got autocompletion working for the new objects yet, nor documentation. (You will get some JS errors with the help files because of that, no worries)

===
# TB2 Alpha-01:
